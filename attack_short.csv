By Jeff Goldman  |  Posted January 04, 2013 Share                                   A recent cyber attack on Japan's Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries apparently resulted in the theft of more than 3,000 classified documents, including several related to negotiations over the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade agreement.  ""The stolen documents are suspected to be internal ministry materials created just before the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit on November 2011 and before a Japan-U.S. meeting concerning the TPP on April 2012,"" writes The Japan Daily Press' Ida Torres. ""One document contained a draft statement to be issued by then Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda and U.S. President Barack Obama regarding the TPP. More than 20 of the files believed to be stolen are highly confidential documents related to Japans roadmap for participating in the TPP talks as well as analysis of the consequences of delaying a decision to join it.""  ""The attack on the Japanese Ministry apparently involved a remotely operated trojan along with a connection bouncer called 'HTran,'"" writes PCMag.com's Max Eddy. ""Dell's SecureWorks has looked at HTran before, and believe it was originally created by a Chinese hacker to conceal the location of command and control servers and 'redirect TCP traffic destined for one host to an alternate host.'""  ""The National Information Security Center of the Cabinet Secretariat discovered about one year ago that suspicious transmissions involving HTran had occurred at the ministry,"" The Daily Yomiuri reports. ""An information security expert said HTran is often used in cyber-attacks to steal information, as it can send data secretly. The program was also used to steal data from the Finance Ministry, as HTran data transmissions were discovered to have taken place from October 2010 to November 2011, the sources said.""

(the Company) confirmed that its computer network was the target of an external, criminal cyber attack that the Company believes occurred in April and June, 2014. The Company and its forensic expert, Mandiant (a FireEye Company), believe the attacker was an Advanced Persistent Threat group originating from China who used highly sophisticated malware and technology to attack the Companys systems. The attacker was able to bypass the Companys security measures and successfully copy and transfer certain data outside the Company. Since first learning of this attack, the Company has worked closely with federal law enforcement authorities in connection with their investigation and possible prosecution of those determined to be responsible for this attack. The Company also engaged Mandiant, who has conducted a thorough investigation of this incident and is advising the Company regarding remediation efforts. Immediately prior to the filing of this Report, the Company completed eradication of the malware from its systems and finalized the implementation of other remediation efforts that are designed to protect against future intrusions of this type. The Company has been informed by federal authorities and Mandiant that this intruder has typically sought valuable intellectual property, such as medical device and equipment development data. However, in this instance the data transferred was non-medical patient identification data related to the Companys physician practice operations and affected approximately 4.5 million individuals who, in the last five years, were referred for or received services from physicians affiliated with the Company. The Company has confirmed that this data did not include patient credit card, medical or clinical information; the data is, however, considered protected under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) because it includes patient names, addresses, birthdates, telephone numbers and social security numbers. The Company is providing appropriate notification to affected patients and regulatory agencies as required by federal and state law. The Company will also be offering identity theft protection services to individuals affected by this attack. The Company carries cyber/privacy liability insurance to protect it against certain losses related to matters of this nature. While this matter may result in remediation expenses, regulatory inquiries, litigation and other liabilities, at this time, the Company does not believe this incident will have a material adverse effect on its business or financial results."

But sometimes, justice is served. A Clinton woman has been sentenced to prison and ordered to pay restitution after pleading guilty to identity theft and other crimes, according to a release from Attorney General Jim Hood today.  The release lists the crimes of Emily Kristen McLellan-Bilbo, 25, of Clinton. On Friday, McLellan-Bilbo pleaded guilty to one count of felonious identity theft, one count of uttering counterfeit instruments and two counts of felonious use of a Social Security number or identifying information to obtain goods.  Hinds County Circuit Court Judge William A. Gowan sentenced Bilbo to serve 10 years for identity theft with five suspended and four years post release supervision. She was also ordered to pay $13,825.35 in restitution to the victims, $1,000 to the Victims Compensation Fund, and $2,000 for investigative costs. All costs must be paid during her four years post-release supervision. In addition, Bilbo received five years for each of the two counts of felonious use of a Social Security number and five years for uttering a counterfeit instrument. The sentences are to run concurrently.  At the time the crimes were committed, Bilbo worked as a receptionist at Audibel (a hearing aid company) in Jackson where she obtained credit card and other personal identifying information of customers. She then used the information to purchase more than $13,000 in goods, cash, and services.  The release noted that 13 victims of identity theft have been identified. The business owner told the court that he and his wife had been taken in by Bilbo and it had cost them and their family-run business dearly. Other victims of Bilbos crimes asked that Bilbo be sent to jail, that she be held accountable, and that she get some counseling.  I hope Judge Gowans tough sentence and order of restitution for these victims will send a message to others contemplating identity theft, Hood noted.  This case was investigated by Investigator Arthur Kendrick and Auditor Gilda Holbrook of the Attorney Generals Medicaid Fraud Control Unit and prosecuted by Special Assistant Attorney General Sue Perry.  Good work, Attorney General Hood and staff.

Often discussed on this website is the importance of healthcare organizations  and facilities that store individuals healthcare information  must have the necessary HIPAA administrative safeguards in place. Combined with technical and physical safeguards, organizations have a much greater chance at keeping patients protected health information (PHI) secure.  However, when a facility has lax or outdated security measures, it can be difficult to monitor who is accessing certain systems. When that happens, former employees can log into an online database and potentially extract sensitive data, such as PHI or financial records.  Such is the case with the Early Learning Coalition of Palm Beach County. A breach occurred at the Belle Glade office of Family Central, Inc.The Florida facility recently announced on its website that a former employee accessed the electronic database that manages the personal information of individuals applying for or receiving services from the coalition.  The security breach compromised the personal information of individuals whose data is contained in the system, including parents and children residing in Palm Beach County who have received school readiness services or participated in the Voluntary Prekindergarten Education Program, the statement read.  Spokeswoman Tara Laxer told a local CBS affiliate that 177 people are currently known to have affected by the data breach. However, there could be more victims. The former employee had access to more than 230,000 identities through a statewide information system, the news source reported. Moreover, 110,000 of those records had valid Social Security numbers.  The breach occurred when an employee accessed the database in an unauthorized manner in order to obtain the personal information, including social security numbers, of individuals contained in the database, explained the statement. The employee is no longer employed by Family Central.  State and federal officials are currently investigating the incident, Family Central stated. Individuals whose information was known to have been compromised are being notified via email. However, people who have received services from the organization are encouraged to carefully monitor their credit history and enroll for free fraud alerts with one of the three major credit agencies. Family Central has not yet reported that they will offer any free credit services to those potentially affected by the data breach.  Family Central has implemented additional security measures including expanded security training for all employees, further restricting access to the information system and revising data security policies, the statement said.  Another key thing for organizations to remember is that all third-parties must be aware of the potential privacy risks, and implement the proper security measures to keep data safe. Just last week a New York health insurer had to notify Medicare subscribers that a subcontractor mishandled their PHI. As previously reported, the third-party vendor had a computer coding error, which caused denial letters to be sent to the wrong members. The compromised data included patients names, addresses, member ID numbers and general descriptions of the procedures."

Victor Gevers, a Dutch internet expert from the non-profit group GDI.Foundation, found the insecure data cache while searching for open databases in China. He posted a series of screenshots of it over the weekend.  The database, whose server is in China, included fields labeled in English for sex, age, education, marital status, as well as a column titled ‚ÄúBreedReady‚Äù, which could be a poor translation of Chinese terms to describe whether a woman has children or is of child-bearing age, observers noted. It was taken down late on Monday afternoon local time, according to Gevers.  The data breach is alarming in the context of official concerns over China‚Äôs falling birthrates. Women rights advocates and critics of China‚Äôs use of strict family planning rules worry about how far the government will go to encourage more women to have children.  It is not clear whether the database is related to a dating app, a government registry, or another organisation or company. Gevers, who also identified a database maintained by a surveillance company tracking at least 2.5 million residents in Xinjiang, said he was still taking samples and working on verifying the data.  ‚ÄúMore than this, we don‚Äôt have at the moment. Our primary concern is that it gets secured ASAP,‚Äù he told the Guardian.  The average age of women in the database was 32, with the youngest being 15, he said. Almost 90% of included entries were described single and 82% were listed as living in Beijing.  The database also included fields labeled ‚Äúpolitical‚Äù and ‚Äúhasvideo‚Äù as well as links to what appear to be Facebook profile pages. Facebook is blocked in China and can only be accessed through virtual private networks.  Other IT specialists believed the database could have been built by a hacker who stole secured data from a dating website. Gevers said he and others were contacting some of those whose profile pages were linked to see if they were aware of the database or had registered such information.  In a thread titled ‚ÄúIs this the prologue to The Handmaid‚Äôs Tale?‚Äù on the discussion forum Douban, Chinese internet users likened the database to the television show based on a future where women are forced to reproduce.  ‚ÄúThis kind of database is very indicative and frightening,‚Äù said one user, adding: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a pessimist and the fact that stories like The Handmaid‚Äôs Tale exist means the signs are already there.‚Äù  Others were less surprised and wondered whether the information could be related to the Chinese dating website Jiayuan, which was hacked by a security researcher aiming to highlight the site‚Äôs vulnerabilities in 2015. One user on Douban wrote: ‚ÄúTo tell the truth, this kind of data is everywhere.‚Äù"

Discovered by security researcher Bob Diachenko, ApexSMS, an SMS text marketing company has suffered a data breach exposing the personally identifiable information of more than 80 million people which was then submitted on an unsecured database.   The exposed database contained 80 million records which included people‚Äôs names, locations, phone numbers and IP addresses, as well as mobile numbers and their network.  Very little is known about the company ApexSMS other than it relies on ‚ÄòMobile Drop‚Äô, a cloud based SMS platform. Mobile Drip simply allows users to send pre-written messages in bulk. Upon further investigation Diachenko identified that ApexSMS is also the same name of an SMS Bombing program.  Diachenko defines SMS Bombing as:  ‚ÄúA software program that duplicates the same message multiple times or rotates different messages and sends all the messages to a number of your choice.‚Äù  SMS Bombing can be used for marketing products or services, as well as for harassment.  An estimated 38 million messages had been sent through disposable toll-free phone numbers, of which 2.1 million victims clicked on the link in the message. The  database  kept track of those who clicked on the links, which then led victims to scam sites. Their credentials were scraped and then submitted to the ApexSMS‚Äô spam database. The database also recorded when victims replied, with more than 115,000 people responding to the spam texts.  Mobile Drip denied any connection to ApexSMS stating:  ‚ÄúWe take compliance and data security very seriously, and we are currently investigating to determine to what extent our information has been exposed to unauthorized parties. We have currently engaged an outside legal firm to assist with our investigation of this matter and we are also engaging a cyber security firm to perform a security audit.  ‚ÄúOur servers have always been password protection, so any information that may have been acquired was done so through illegal means with the goal of harming the reputation and financial success of the business.‚Äù  Diachenko said:  ‚ÄúThis incident raises the issue once again that data security can affect legitimate businesses and what many would consider ‚Äògray marketing‚Äô at best.‚Äù "

Allergy Associates is a health care practice that specializes in treating individuals with allergies, and is comprised of three doctors at four locations across Connecticut.  In February 2015, a patient of Allergy Associates contacted a local television station to speak about a dispute that had occurred between the patient and an Allergy Associates‚Äô doctor. The reporter subsequently contacted the doctor for comment and the doctor impermissibly disclosed the patient‚Äôs protected health information to the reporter.  OCR‚Äôs investigation found that the doctor‚Äôs discussion with the reporter demonstrated a reckless disregard for the patient‚Äôs privacy rights and that the disclosure occurred after the doctor was instructed by Allergy Associates‚Äô Privacy Officer to either not respond to the media or respond with ‚Äúno comment.‚Äù Additionally, OCR‚Äôs investigation revealed that Allergy Associates failed to take any disciplinary action against the doctor or take any corrective action following the impermissible disclosure to the media.  ‚ÄúWhen a patient complains about a medical practice, doctors cannot respond by disclosing private patient information to the media,‚Äù said OCR Director Roger Severino. ‚ÄúBecause egregious disclosures can lead to substantial penalties, covered entities need to pay close attention to HIPAA‚Äôs privacy rules, especially when responding to press inquiries.‚Äù  In addition to the monetary settlement, Allergy Associates will undertake a corrective action plan that includes two years of monitoring their compliance with the HIPAA Rules.

She was sentenced to serve up to six months in a detention center, to serve 10 years on probation during which she can't work in the health care field and to pay a $12,500 fine.  The reasons she gave were vague. She told police she had personal issues that caused her to stop caring about her job, that she had fallen behind processing the piles of mammogram films that stacked up. So she went into the hospital's computer system, assumed the identities of physicians, and gave each patient a clear reading, an investigative report says. That allowed her to avoid the time-consuming paperwork required before the films are brought to a reading room for radiologists to examine, her lawyer Floyd Buford told the AP.  Her actions were uncovered in April 2010 after a patient who'd received a negative report had another mammogram three months later at another hospital that revealed she had breast cancer. As hospital staff began to investigate, it was determined that the doctor whose name was on the faulty report had not been at the hospital the day the report was filed. Rapraeger quickly confessed to her supervisor that she was responsible and was fired from her job about a week later, according to an investigator's report."
